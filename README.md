# SONAR - Rock vs Mine Prediction

Project Sonar focuses on leveraging Python and logistic regression for rock vs. mine prediction in underwater environments. The primary objective is to enhance sonar signal processing to discriminate between rocks and mines, crucial for naval and marine safety.

For this project, a dataset was carefully selected and split into training and testing sets. This division enables the model to learn from one subset and validate its performance on another, ensuring generalization. Python, with its powerful libraries, was employed to preprocess the dataset and implement the logistic regression model.

The logistic regression model serves as the predictive engine, utilizing mathematical functions to estimate the probability of an input belonging to a particular class—in this case, distinguishing between rocks and mines. 

Logistic regression is a type of regression analysis that is used to model the probability of a binary dependent variable. It is a popular statistical method for classification problems where the goal is to predict the probability of an event occurring or not occurring. In logistic regression, the model uses a sigmoid function to transform the linear combination of predictor variables into a value between 0 and 1, which is interpreted as the probability of the dependent variable taking on a specific value. The logistic regression model is used in various fields, including healthcare, marketing, and finance.

To enhance user interaction, an intuitive data input system was designed. Users can input sonar data, and the model swiftly processes it, providing a prediction on whether the input represents a rock or a mine. This user-friendly interface facilitates real-time decision-making in marine scenarios, offering a practical solution for underwater threat detection using logistic regression in Python.
